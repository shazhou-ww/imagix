feat: entity lifecycle (endEvent, $alive, soft delete) + UI improvements

Backend:
- Add endEventId and deletedAt to Character/Thing/Relationship schemas
- Add $alive system attribute, set true on birth and false on end
- Remove relationshipChanges from StateImpact (lifecycle via dedicated API)
- Add end/undoEnd controllers and routes for all three entity types
- Soft delete: entities filtered by deletedAt instead of hard delete
- Add updateRelationship to repository
- Add validateParticipantsAlive to event creation/update
- State computation caps at death time, stops time formulas after death
- Birth/end time validation in entity controllers and event update

Frontend:
- Lifecycle chips (birth/end) on Character, Thing, Relationship list pages
- End entity dialogs with client-side time validation (useMemo)
- Collapsible event timeline with summary count chips
- Boolean attributes use Switch control, display yes/no
- Era toggle on EpochTimeInput with showEraToggle prop
- Duration mode: 0-based month/day, no era toggle
- No year 0: display years+1 in all timestamp contexts
- Event edit validates birth/end time constraints with inline alerts
- Server-side error fallback via onError handlers
